Part1
I like art that's abstract and doesn't have a clear answer. Wassily Kandinsky's bold use of color, shape and line in his works makes these seemingly simple and absurd works full of emotion. These elements are also often layered and interlaced to create the depth of the work.

I want to add abstract concepts to my work, using simple shapes and lines, using bold colors, to portray my ideal "world". But this is only the world in my understanding, and in the understanding of others it is a completely different world. Because each person's experience and dream are different, there will be great differences in the understanding of a case or artwork that is not accurately answered.

Part2
Program generation is a coding technique that mimics the spontaneous and dynamic nature of abstract works by using algorithms to dynamically generate geometric shapes, colors, and patterns. Procedural generation allows for infinite variations in images, promotes creativity and a spirit of exploration, and can create complex and visually appealing images.
